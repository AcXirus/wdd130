        <p>My name is Dillan Samuel Torres, I am from Ecuador and I am studying <strong>software development</strong>. I like to read books, swimming, listening to music, and sports, especially "basketball"
            since I was a child I have always been attracted to programming but I never took a step to learn, in the time when I was serving mission I met a very good friend who encouraged me to start on this path 
            and today I feel good and every day I learn something new. One of my goals when learning to program and develop software is to be able to work in a good company like "Microsoft" and also to study other branches of programming and technology. 
            I hope to continue learning more about programming and software.</p>
